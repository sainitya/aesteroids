RiceRocks (Asteroids) (May 31, 2015)

My retouched solution of the mini-project #8 of the course

Run on (maybe very slow on some browsers):
  - Chrome 31
  - Firefox 26
  - Safari 5.1.7 (without sounds)
  - Python 2.7 and 3.4 with SimpleGUICS2Pygame.

Fix me:
  - Collision problem when divide a big asteroid in two little asteroids.

Piece of SimpleGUICS2Pygame.
